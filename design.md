# POEM

I have an uncharacteristic tendancy toward superstition.
It's not something I quite know how to contend with.
I'm wary of inevitability.
I'm wary of universals.
But they're comforting aren't they?

But in the end, more than anything, I hope that I've fed you well, and all the little things that ate me up.
One day, a worm, or a very peristent crow, will be a little less hungry.
I'll be better then.
In dirt and sand, painted wooden boards, I'll be better.
